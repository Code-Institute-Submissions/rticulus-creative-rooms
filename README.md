Everything we do begins with discovery and understanding, which gives our creativity meaning and our work a permanent relevance.


## UX

The idea driving the website is a simple immediate and convenientinterface with lots of colorful flat images that invite the client to immediately sourcean easy way the book or contact the program leaders. The nature of our modus operandi is CREATIVITY NATURALLY. The more natural and accessible the better...

- User: *"As a user, I want to be able to book a consultancy online, so that it fits around my schedules."*
- Dev:  We have added a form with a booking calendar to make this easy for you

- User: *"As a user, I want to know when the next time you are in our area , I have lots of teacher friends who would be so interested in this."*
- Dev: In the future we add a blog and newsletter informing our users where we have been, what we have done and where we will be going next. Look out for video and photos soon.

- User: *"Joe User here, I would like to be able to choose my coach, so that I know I am getting the same level of service, consistently."*
- Dev: All our staff are talented however if you have a preference we can add the availability of staff to the Booking Form.

#### 1. Strategy
My idea was predominantly fo rreturning customers who wanted to maintain regular sessions with us. Very few distractions and a site that is soft on the eye. My approach is to set everything on one page and keep the information short but informative.  

##### Project Goals:

- Provide more bookings for the business

- Generate interest in the services available.

- Make access to direct communication with us on social media.

##### Customer Goals:

- Ability to book a timely consultation
	
- Direct communication with the the company

- Value for money

#### 2. Scope

The site is primarily a booking site for community members and community artists:

- Simple pastel colours with easy to read content

- Visual hover animation

- 1-page with 3x links from navigation and hamburger

- A booking form for client information so they can be contacted

- Location via an interactive map

- Booking Form



#### 4. Skeleton Surface

- Wireframes: defined 1-page 4 sections, and floating form

- First and Home page is Office, then Products section with booking button

- Javscript hamburger menu

- Footer with Social Media links

## Features

- Clickable images: These clicks lead to a sign-up form or relevant documents or insights. 

- Click Papilion logo on any page and it returns you to the first page.

- Booking Form: Pop-Up Booking Form with basic details- name, addresss, email and a button that invokes it.

- Carousel: 3 short testimonials on a loop

## Features left to implement

Wishlist of ideas to be implemented at a future date:

* Clickable images with external pages 

* Online FAQs and downloadable Resource packs


## __Technology Used__

Below are tools used to devise this project:

* Markdown
    * For the ReadMe file
* HTML 5
    * For the base information and structure of the webpages
* CSS 3
    * For the styling and beauty of the webpages
* Javascript 
    * For the carousel and hamburger menu animation    
* Bootstrap 4 
    * For the booking Form


## Testing

* The first few commits were big structural dumps, testing the skeleton structure and then the skeleton with placeholders, all worked well. 

1. Booking form:
    1. Go to the "Book Us Here" button on any page or the "Book Now" page (which is a pop-up):
    2. Try to submit the empty form and an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form without an email address and an error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form without a Booking Date and you will return to your original page, informing Papilion you required consultation 	 with an interest to book.
    5. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and you have completed submission and will be returned to your original page
