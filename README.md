## UX

The idea driving the website is a simple immediate and convenientinterface with lots of colorful flat images that invite the client to immediately sourcean easy way the book or contact the program leaders. The nature of our modus operandi is CREATIVITY NATURALLY. The more natural and accessible the better...

- User: *"As a user, I want to be able to book a consultancy online, so that it fits around my schedules."*
- Dev:  We have added a form with a booking calendar to make this easy for you

- User: *"As a user, I want to know when the next time you are in our area , I have lots of teacher friends who would be so interested in this."*
- Dev: In the future we add a blog and newsletter informing our users where we have been, what we have done and where we will be going next. Look out for video and photos soon.

- User: *"Joe User here, I would like to be able to choose my coach, so that I know I am getting the same level of service, consistently."*
- Dev: All our staff are talented however if you have a preference we can add the availability of staff to the Booking Form.

#### 1. Strategy
My idea was predominantly fo rreturning customers who wanted to maintain regular sessions with us. Very few distractions and a site that is soft on the eye. My approach is to set everything on one page and keep the information short but informative.  

##### Project Goals:

- Provide more bookings for the business

- Generate interest in the services available.

- Make access to direct communication with us on social media.

##### Customer Goals:

- Ability to book a timely consultation
	
- Direct communication with the the company

- Value for money

#### 2. Scope

The site is primarily a booking site for community members and community artists:

- Simple pastel colours with easy to read content

- Visual hover animation

- 1-page with 3x links from navigation and hamburger

- A booking form for client information so they can be contacted

- Location via an interactive map

- Booking Form



#### 4. Skeleton Surface

- Wireframes: defined 1-page 4 sections, and floating form
