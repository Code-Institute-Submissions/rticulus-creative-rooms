## UX

The idea driving the website operations is to engage and entertain you through the process, subconsciously educating yourself. With lots colorful flat images that invite the client to be inquisitive about the kind of people behind the projects and business. The nature of our modus operandi is CREATIVITY NATURALLY. The more natural and accessible the better...

- As a user, I want to be able to book a consultancy online, so that it fits around my schedules.

- As a user, I want know when the next time you are in our area , I have lots of teacher friends who would be so interested in this.

- Joe User here, I would like to be able to choose my coach, so that I know I am getting the same level of service, consistently.

## Features

- Hover over blocks: Letters and images animate as they are hovered over. Each object 'blinks' for 1.25 passing seconds, giving the website a really transition that you could play with for hours

- Clickable images: These clicks lead to a sign-up form or relevant documents or insights. The idea behind this was to engage more young people (and adults if they choose) in understanding the process behind the production of our daily-use electronic appliances or applications that they themselves engage with. On mobile the 'click would be responsive to touch input and pending on how many times clicked it would buzz through a 20second, 40 second or 60second old classic, like 'The A Team or Star Trek, etc.

- Interactive toggles: When on a computer or tablet the same gallery can be accessed but without the immediate reverb you get on a mobile phone. Not to worry, the game is still on because instead it would be visual and possibly audio too.

- A light game: It would give you an idea of the power of electricity in our lives and advise on how to save power through its fun onboard automatic brightness detector.

- Fun outdoor activities and events: Follow our links in the built-in app. Via the messaging facility we will be able to remind you of your upcoming appointments with us.

## Existing Features

- Feature 1 - Hover over: At the moment this is working, and the animation is smooth.

- JavaScript animated menubar: Really fun animated hamburger-menu that almost raises its hands when you click it
